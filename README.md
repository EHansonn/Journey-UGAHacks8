# Journey

A social media site to share and plan your journeys, and connect with people who live at the places you plan to visit. Create a profile, plan and share your trips, and discover others like you.

## Inspiration
Other social media sites are often used as a platform to share your travels, but they lack the ability to upload and share your travel experiences in an organized manner. 

## What it does
We built a social media platform that allows you upload your past trips and plan future ones. We then present this data in an organized and visual form on your profile. Customize your trips by uploading images, selecting a date, location, and a description. On your profile you can see your trips on a interactive Google Map, that shows markers to indicate your travels. Selecting your current location and trips will connect you with others who share similar interests and travel plans. 

## How we built it
We used Typescript, powered by NextJS and react.  We used SQL to store the users data inside a database. We used the Google Maps api to make the interactive display of your travel plans. We also used AWS to allow for users to upload images. For the styling, used tailwind to make the website visually appealing.

## Challenges we ran into 
One challenge that was faced was getting valid location inputs that integarte with the Google maps api. To get around this problem, we integrated a predictive input that suggested locations that would function with the api. 


## Accomplishments that we're proud of 

One thing we're proud of is the SQL database we set up. 

## What we learned
